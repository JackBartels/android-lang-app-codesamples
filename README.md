<h3>! Important !</h3>
All code made available here is a WORK IN PROGRESS and is not promised to represent the quality nor functionality of a final product.
<br/><br/><br/>
In this repo, I have made available a small selection of the source files from my Android app. It is a 2D retro-style game that presents foreign language vocabulary learning as an adventure with minigames and exploration.
<br/><br/>
Because of the smaller scale of the project, I opted to write my own engine rather than utilizing a third-party tool such as Unity.
<br/><br/>
In addition to typical files that facilitate Android functionality, the main project contains primarily code written in Java and features a SQLite database.
